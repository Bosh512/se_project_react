# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

The project utilizes a front end created with React, connected to an Express back end. We also used Postman and MongoDB to verify the integrity of the code through testing.

A link to the back end is below.

This read me will be finished on final submission.
