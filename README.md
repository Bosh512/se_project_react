# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

Users are able to sign in, and must do so to create new cards that display their clothing items. The clothing items are then displayed based on the weather, and can be liked or deleted so long as the user is signed in. New ones can also be added by signed in users.

There is a demonstration video that goes into full lengths of the sites functions below.

## Technologies Used

The front end of this project was created using React, HTML, and CSS. The HTML components, linked to CSS stylesheets, were broken down into seperate React components to ensure clean code and an overall more organized project, which will aid developement to add future fucntionality to the project.

The back end of this project was created using Express.js. A server was run using scripts that allowed for the use of a local server, so that we could effectively and efficiently test all API endpoints and their associated functions in the application. MongoDB and Postman were also used to test these endpoints.

We use "npm run dev" on both the front and back ends to launch the server with the hot reload feature for ease of use purposes.

A link to the back end is below.
